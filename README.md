One phrase review: \
*Base version seemed to be done*

Release candidate for base version,
you can play to your heart content versus yourself,

## Build and run

First of all - install [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org).

Setup it on first launch:

`stack setup`

For launching client:

`stack build && stack exec poker`

## Testing

Added some hand templates to test detecting and comparing of combinations.
Although isn't pretending to be a good test coverage and still requires a human eye
to verify results.

For launching tests:

`stack test`

*Don't even try to run if you don't know what you're exactly doing!*
